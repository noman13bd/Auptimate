Real-time alerting system for monitoring transaction activities
---------------------------------------------------------------

Algorithm and Data Structure
----------------------------
Data Ingestion:
    We can use a message queue or streaming platform to ingest transaction data in real-time. This provides scalability and reliability in handling high volumes of incoming data.

Threshold Alerting:
    For single transaction amount exceeding a pre-defined threshold, we can use a simple rule-based system. As each transaction arrives, compare its amount to the threshold. If the amount exceeds the threshold, trigger an alert to the fund manager. This alert can be immediate or can be queue based system.

Spike Alerting:
    To detect a sudden spike in transaction rate, we can use a sliding time window. Maintain a rolling time window (e.g., 1 hour) and count the number of transactions within that window. Calculate the average transaction rate over the last hour. As each new transaction arrives, update the window and recalculate the rate.  If the current rate exceeds a certain multiple (e.g., 10x) of the average rate, trigger a spike alert. We can use data structures like a deque to maintain the sliding time window efficiently.



System Scalability, Data Integrity and Fault Tolerance
------------------------------------------------------
We can use load balancers to distribute incoming transaction data across multiple processing instances to ensure scalability. Multiple instances of the software will run simultaneously to handle pressure of streams of transactions.
Data replication will be there to ensure data availability and fault tolerance in case of instance failures.
